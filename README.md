# Stellan Sullivan
## 1.	What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
Even though personal drama held me back in graduation, I have not abandoned mine ambitions. Since childhood, it has been mine dream to become a game director. Ergo, I decided years ago that mine major would be Computer Science.
## 2.	What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
Although game design is mine most wanted career, I am looking to increase mine options by learning other computer skills.
## 3.	What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
I have prior experience with Java and C++, although I am rusty. I also have minor experience with C programming.
